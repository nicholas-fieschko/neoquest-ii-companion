A Chrome extension created in 2013 for personal and friend usage. Improves the gameplay experience of online game NeoQuest II through context-sensitive (and strategy-tailored) insertion of hotkeys for virtually all actions (enabling easy pure-keyboard play), as well as modification of HTML to display useful calculated information and context-sensitive alerts, functional UI improvements, and minor aesthetic changes.

Extension can be used in Google Chrome by enabling developer mode on the extensions page, choosing "load unpacked extension", and selecting the folder containing the extension's code. Extension is only active while playing NeoQuest II on Neopets.com (account required for access).
