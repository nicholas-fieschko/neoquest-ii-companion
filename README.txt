A Chrome extension created in 2013 for personal and friend usage. Improves the gameplay experience of online game NeoQuest II through context-sensitive (and strategy-tailored) insertion of hotkeys for virtually all actions (enabling easy pure-keyboard play), as well as modification of HTML to display useful calculated information and context-sensitive alerts, functional UI improvements, and minor aesthetic changes.

Note: Code remained a work-in-progress and does not live up to my usual standards of documentation, in part due to an extremely small target audience (1-2 people), but nonetheless demonstrates much of my usual coding style and conventions, as well as my desire to create tools to enhance efficient and intuitive workflow.

Extension can be used in Google Chrome by enabling developer mode on the extensions page, choosing "load unpacked extension", and selecting the folder containing the extension's code. Extension is only active while playing NeoQuest II on Neopets.com (account required for access).
