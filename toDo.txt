This is just a text file of personal notes and to-do items. Usually saved as .js for syntax highlighting (comments specifically).
Commented out (re: JS syntax) sections indicate feature having been implemented successfully.

To do: 
read everything on this website: http://diveintohtml5.info/
									(from http://diveintohtml5.info/storage.html)


BATTLE
	FIGHT
	// next: in battle, left/right keys select enemies:
	// 	hit left, start on leftmost enemy
	// 	right, start on rightmost
	// then, after initial, left/right goes left or right

	implement special boss behavior:
		// make an array of all the boss names, and have a isBossBattle function. In the clickAttack function, 
		// have Mipsy cast damage shields if 
		// 	-it is a boss
		// 	-if not, meaning just normal enemies, only if less than 3
			-also, optional parameter of only case if above ability level X (5 for me)
		
		hasting / slowing checking/acting
		// later, velm throwing up protection shields

	Modify progress key to 
		a) highlight action to be performed with it, (currently attacking or clicking 'next')
		// b) change upon tab to do tab-selected item instead, with a hotkey to go back to default item (instead of having to tab back)

	POTIONS
	group potions into single left-right rotating select menus, with number in that direction displayed over arrows
	5         1  4          0
	< HEAL 35 >  < HASTE 40%> etc (each sep by <br> in practice...)
		healing -- start at second highest 
		haste -- start at highest
		slow -- start at highest
		other -- start at highest (damage potions etc?)
	if you mouse over the arrow for potions to the left or right, it will imm. expand outward 
		and show you the quantity/healing power of the one immediate to the one youre on
	// hitting tab will go to potions (select/highlight, not click)
	// 	(could set tabindex to 1 instead of hotkey?)
	// 	( ^-- but keep it clean, we should still store it in the hotkey script...)
	// 	(i think its .focus() to select)

NAV PAGE
	// figure out and display how much XP until next level?
	// tab goes to talk to people links

	use AJAX to dynamically load map without refreshing the page?


CHROME GEN
reeeead up: http://julip.co/2010/01/how-to-build-a-chrome-extension-part-2-options-and-localstorage/

settings page:
	switch on and off basically all features
	change hotkeys (incl remove)
	dualkey (WASD) or full, single-key navigation (square of keys around WADX area 
													// (do something w center key?))
	switch between idnq and neoquest-mania for when clicking on icon, or specify new URL

	maybe later even make ability to configure(by user settings) battleMoveKey behavior for each character



//NOTES ON "BEFORELOAD" EVENTLISTENER  in nqscript.js FROM STACKOVERFLOW:
	// function doBeforeLoad(event) {
	//     // Check to see if its what you want to redirect
	//     // We also check for a data attribute that we set, so we know its allready been redirected
	//     // we do this because if you redirect a source it will fire another beforeload event for its new url
	//     if (!event.srcElement.dataset['redirected'] && event.srcElement.tagName == "IMG" && event.srcElement.src.endsWith('/test.png')) {
	//         // If it is something we want to redirect then set a data attribute so we know its allready been changed
	//         // Set that attribute to it original src in case we need to know what it was later
	//         event.srcElement.dataset['redirected'] = event.srcElement.src;
	//         // Set the source to the new url you want the element to point to
	//         event.srcElement.src = "replacement.png";
	//     }
	// }

	// document.addEventListener('beforeload', doBeforeLoad, true);
